= Versioning support for hosted control planes

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, the following components of hosted control planes are released:

* HyperShift Operator
* `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` API resources
* Command-line interface (CLI)

The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by `HostedCluster` resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each {product-title} release. Any HyperShift Operator that is released with a minor _n_ version of {product-title} must support _n_, _n-1_, and _n-2_ minor versions of {product-title}.

The CLI is a helper utility for development purposes. The CLI is released as part of any HyperShift Operator release. No compatibility policies are guaranteed.

The API, `hypershift.openshift.io`, provides a way to create and manage lightweight, flexible, heterogeneous {product-title} clusters at scale. The API exposes two user-facing resources: `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`. A `HostedCluster` resource encapsulates the control plane and common data plane configuration. When you create a `HostedCluster` resource, you have a fully functional control plane with no attached nodes. A `NodePool` resource is a scalable set of worker nodes that is attached to a `HostedCluster` resource.

The `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources are released with each {product-title} release. Any `HostedCluster` or `NodePool` resources that are released for a minor _n_ version of {product-title} must support _n_, _n-1_, and _n-2_ minor versions of {product-title}. The API version policy generally aligns with the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning[Kubernetes API versioning].
